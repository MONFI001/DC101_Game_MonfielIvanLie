Description:
The Card Guessing Game is a browser-based interactive game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges the player’s memory and attention by requiring them to track a specific numbered card while multiple cards are shuffled on the screen.

At the start of each round, six cards labeled with numbers 1 to 6 are displayed. One number is randomly selected as the target card, which the player must find. The cards briefly reveal their numbers, then flip face down and are shuffled in random directions to confuse the player. After the shuffle, the player must guess the correct card by clicking on it.

The game includes three difficulty levels—Easy, Normal, and Hard—which affect the speed of the shuffle animation. Players are given a limited number of attempts to find the correct card. Sound effects are used to enhance gameplay feedback, including shuffle sounds, click sounds, and win or lose audio cues.

The game provides a restart option, clear win and lose messages, and smooth card flip animations. This project demonstrates core concepts of web development such as DOM manipulation, event handling, CSS animations, and audio integration, making it both an educational and entertaining application.
